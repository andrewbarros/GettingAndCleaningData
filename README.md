# How to use this script
1. `download_data.sh` will download the data from the class website and unzip it in the current directory. The script expects the Samsung Data to be in a subdirectory called "UCI HAR Dataset"
2. `run_analysis.R` will create a file called `tidy.csv` that meets the class requirements. This can either be run from the GUI or the command line (`R -f run_analysis.R`)
